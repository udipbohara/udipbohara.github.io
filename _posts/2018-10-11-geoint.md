### San Antonio Walmart Study

San Antonio, TX has 27 Walmart locations - the most of any city in the United States. These stores include Supercenters, Sam’s Clubs, and Neighborhood Markets. Three locations were closed in 2018.2 The Walmart Board of Directors requires further direction for San Antonio and their continued presence in the city. In particular, there are two questions they need answered. First, should they close additional stores in the city? They often look for stores that are within three miles of one another as potential locations for closure. Second, are there areas that could support a new Walmart location? These are extremely important questions, especially for current and potential employees.

### An Analysis of the Spartly Islands

The Spratly Islands (Reefs) are a contested area in the South China Sea. These islands are claimed by numerous countries and are in the middle of a vital shipping lane. Control of these islands could signal a shift in naval and economic hegemony in the region – and perhaps even the world. It is imperative for national security that the United States keeps updated records regarding these islands – and in particular Chinese attempts to use them as strategic launching pads for its expansion.

### The Threat of Terrorism Across Administrative Units

As the United States continues to coordinate counterterrorism efforts with the Afghani government, a more geographically refined look at terrorist activity in the country is necessary. It is clear that the country, as a whole, experiences more terrorism than other countries around the world, but are there more finite administrative areas that are more likely to experience this form of violence? This is your tasking: what is the distribution of terrorist attacks across Afghanistan at the province and district levels? Further, which administrative level should counterterrorism resources be allocated to?

### City of Toronto Public Safety Study

After a $7 million pilot program, Toronto, Canada and its suburbs now have 300+ red light cameras. The cameras take pictures of vehicles that enter an intersection despite a red traffic signal. These photos can then be used to enforce traffic laws. The city has evidence that the cameras do deter individuals from running red lights. They’ve found that angle collisions, which are often indicative of running a red light, have gone down by 60%.*

### The Geographic Impact of Disease Spread

Pennathur is a village in Southern India and is one of 44 villages that are part of a Dengue Fever study. Dengue Fever is a painful, potentially fatal illness that is spread by a tiny mosquito, and unfortunately it is quite common in Southeast Asia and Central America. It is estimated that as many as 100 million people contract this disease each year...and health agencies are still years away from finding a vaccine.
