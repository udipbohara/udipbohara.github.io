## About Me
I am a Graduate student studying Data Science in Mercyhurst University. 
I am currently the Graduate reserach Assistant for the Department of Data Science and Cyber Security. 

-----

## Current Interests:
Statistical inference, experimental design, machine learning interpretability/explainability, forecasting(econometrics and deep learning), geospatial data analytics and recommendation engines with integration of NoSQL database platforms (MongoDB and Neo4j).

-----

### Relevant Courses:
Probability and Statistics, Algorithm Development, Data Structures and Algorithms, Data Wrangling, Relational and Non-Relational Databases, Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Text Mining, Research Methods, Reserach Project, Data Visualization, Geospatial Data Analytics

-----

## Past Research (Undergraduate):
Statistical modeling/inference, Causual Inference, Survey and Experimental Design and Hypothesis testing in the field of Biostatistics and Epidemiology with SPSS, Epi Info and STATA:
Clinical epidemiology and use of large administrative data sources, use of maps (GIS) and data visualization, basic statistical programming and reasoning

### Healthcare Analytics and Biostatistics: 

1. Randomized Crinincal Trials
2. NHAMCS (National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey) survey and PUDF datasets: 
    * Draw out statistical inference (eg. prescription of a particular drug as an outcome) with hypothesis testing and data manipulation with stratified analysis using statistical softwares.
3. The Effect of Digoxin on Mortality and Morbidity in Patients with Heart Failure: 
    * Survival Analysis using Kaplan–Meier and hypothesis testing to study the efficacy of digoxin in mortality and morbidity.

### Applied Epidemiology:
1. Oswego - Outbreak of Gastrointestinal Illness Following a Church Supper
    - Draw, interpret and describe epidemic curve and draw out epidemiological inferences analysis
2. Texarkana — Epidemic Measles in a Divided City
   - Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using a sensitive and/or specific case definition in an epidemic investigation and draw out inference.
3. MRSA Outbreak - 
   - Design survey instruments to gather additional data about the cases, Formulate a hypothesis on transmission, conduct Hypothesis Testing, prepare recommendations.


## Current Research
* Experimental Design/Statistical Modeling.
* Intrusion Detection System(IDS) using various deep learning methods.
* Develop NLP based recommendation system using PySpark and Neo4j.
